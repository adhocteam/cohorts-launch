Scenario 1: Overlapping time windows for different events
- time slots should be open and visible for as long as possible
- different people will necessarily see the same time slots for the same event and different events
- so double booking errors should be as graceful and helpful as possible

Scenario 2: Multiple users trying to book
the same people in different events

- overlapping invitations will be sent to different people
- overlapping time slots will have to be available across events (but not within the same one)
- same graceful handling of validation errors when the same people try to book overalpping time slots
- reservations should not overlapp either a user or a person
- time slots that have been included in invitations to different events by the same user and reserved by a person should not be sent in the invitation
